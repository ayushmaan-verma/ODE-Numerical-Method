# Numerical Solution of First-Order Differential Equations in C++

This project presents a C++ implementation of standard numerical methods for solving first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs).

The program is designed for educational and computational purposes, allowing users to compare the accuracy of different numerical techniques.

## Overview

The code numerically approximates solutions of first-order ODEs using the following methods:

1. Euler Method  
2. Modified Euler Method (Heun’s Method)  
3. Fourth-Order Runge–Kutta Method (RK4)

A single interface function allows selection of the desired method and computation of the approximate solution at a specified point.
